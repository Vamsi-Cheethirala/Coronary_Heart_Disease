    <h3>💡 What is coronary heart disease (CHD)?</h3>
    <p>
        CHD is a condition where the blood vessels that supply the heart muscle become narrowed or blocked. This can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, or heart attacks.

    <h3>📊 What are the 13 input features?</h3>
    <p>
        The inputs include medical and lifestyle indicators such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type</li>
            <li>Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol</li>
            <li>Fasting Blood Sugar, Rest ECG Results</li>
            <li>Max Heart Rate Achieved, Exercise-induced Angina</li>
            <li>Oldpeak (ST depression), ST slope, Thalassemia</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>🤖 How does this tool work?</h3>
    <p>
        We use machine learning models trained on real patient data to analyze your input and estimate your risk of CHD. Four models are used: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and KNN.
    </p>

    <h3>⚠️ Is this a medical diagnosis?</h3>
    <p>
        No. This tool is for educational purposes only and not a replacement for a professional medical consultation. Always consult your doctor for medical decisions.
    </p>

    <h3>📈 How accurate is it?</h3>
    <p>
        Accuracy depends on the model and input data. On our training dataset, Random Forest performed best with around 85% accuracy.
